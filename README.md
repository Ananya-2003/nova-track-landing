# NovaTrack - Marketing Landing

Simple React + Vite landing page built mobile-first with Tailwind CSS.

## Run locally
1. `npm install`
2. `npm run dev`
3. Open the URL shown by Vite (usually http://localhost:5173)

## What I built
- Header (mobile-friendly)
- Hero with CTA
- Feature grid (6 features)
- Social proof (logos + testimonials)
- Pricing toggle (monthly / annual)
- CTA footer

## Notes
This page was implemented to be small, accessible, and easy to explain in interviews.
