# Nova Track Landing â€” local notes for pushing

This repo is ready to be pushed to GitHub. Before pushing, make sure you have:

- Node.js >= 20.19.0 (you upgraded) and npm installed
- Run `npm install` locally to restore dependencies

Quick start (dev):

```powershell
npm install
npm run dev
```

Notes:
- Tailwind is configured via `postcss.config.cjs` and `tailwind.config.js`.
- For quick verification I generated `public/tw.css` (can be ignored and is in `.gitignore`).
